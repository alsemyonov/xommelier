      # OPTIONAL: Indicates how frequently the content at a particular URL is
      # likely to change. The value "always" should be used to describe
      # documents that change each time they are accessed. The value "never"
      # should be used to describe archived URLs. Please note that web
      # crawlers may not necessarily crawl pages marked "always" more often.
      # Consider this element as a friendly suggestion and not a command.

      # on the same site. The value for this element is a number between
      # 0.0 and 1.0 where 0.0 identifies the lowest priority page(s).
      # The default priority of a page is 0.5. Priority is used to select
      # between pages on your site. Setting a priority of 1.0 for all URLs
      # will not help you, as the relative priority of pages on your site
      # is what will be considered.
