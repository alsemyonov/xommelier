        <![CDATA[One element is defined.

license -- if present as a sub-element of <channel>, indicates that the content of the RSS file is available under a license, indicated by a URL, which is the value of the license element. A list of some licenses that may be used in this context is on the Creative Commons website on this page, however the <license> element may point to licenses not authored by Creative Commons.

You may also use the <license> element as a sub-element of <item>. When used this way it applies only to the content of that item. If an item has a license, and the channel does too, the license on the item applies, i.e. the inner license overrides the outer one.

Multiple <license> elements are allowed, in either context, indicating that the content is available under multiple licenses.]]>
